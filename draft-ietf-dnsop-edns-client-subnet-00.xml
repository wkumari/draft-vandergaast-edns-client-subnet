    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Many Authoritative Nameservers today return different replies based
      on the perceived topological location of the user. These servers use the
      IP address of the incoming query to identify that location. Since most
      queries come from intermediate Recursive Resolvers, the source address
      is that of the Recursive Resolver rather than of the query
      originator.</t>

      <t>Traditionally, and probably still in the majority of instances,
      Recursive Resolvers are reasonably close in the network topology to the
      Stub Resolvers or Forwarders that are the source of queries. For these
      resolvers, using their own IP address is sufficient for authority
      servers that tailor responses based upon location of the querier.</t>

      <t>Increasingly, though, a class of Recursive Resolvers has arisen that
      handle query sources that are often not topologically close. The
      motivation for a user to configure such a Centralized Resolver varies
      but is usually because of some enhanced experience, such as greater
      cache security or applying policies regarding where users may connect.
      (Although political censorship usually comes to mind here, the same
      actions may be used by a parent when setting controls on where a minor
      may connect.) Similarly, many ISPs and other organizations use a
      Centralized Resolver infrastructure that can be distant from the clients
      the resolvers serve. The cases all lead to less than desirable replies
      from topology-sensitive Authoritative Nameservers.</t>

      <t>This draft defines an <xref target="RFC6891">EDNS0</xref> option to
      convey network information that is relevant to the DNS message. It will
      carry sufficient network information about the originator for the
      Authoritative Nameserver to tailor responses. It will also provide for
      the Authoritative Nameserver to indicate the scope of network addresses
      for which the tailored answer is intended. This EDNS0 option is intended
      for those recursive and authority servers that would benefit from the
      extension and not for general purpose deployment. It is completely
      optional and can safely be ignored by servers that choose not to
      implement it or enable it.</t>

      <t>This draft also includes guidelines on how to best cache those
      results and provides recommendations on when this protocol extension
      should be used.</t>

          <t hangText="Recursive Resolver:">A nameserver that is responsible
          for resolving domain names for clients by following the domain's
          delegation chain. Recursive Resolvers frequently use caches to be
          able to respond to client queries quickly. Described in <xref

          to a Recursive Resolver. It is possible to have a chain of

          topological perspective, and two geographically distant hosts can be
          quite close on the network.</t>

    <section anchor="overview" title="Overview">
      <t>The general idea of this document is to provide an EDNS0 option to
      allow Recursive Resolvers, if they are willing, to forward details about
      the origin network from which a query is coming when talking to
      Authoritative Nameservers.</t>

      <t>The format of this option is described in <xref target="format"/>,
      and is meant to be added in queries sent by Intermediate Nameservers in
      a way transparent to Stub Resolvers and end users, as described in <xref
      target="originating"/>. ECS is only defined for the Internet (IN) DNS
      class.</t>

      <t>As described in <xref target="responding"/>, an Authoritative
      Nameserver could use this EDNS0 option as a hint to better locate the
      network of the end user and provide a better answer.</t>

      <t>Its response would also contain an edns-client-subnet (ECS) option,
      clearly indicating that the server made use of this information, and
      that the answer is tied to the network of the client.</t>

      <t>As described in <xref target="caching"/>, Intermediate Nameservers
      would use this information to cache the reply.</t>

      <t>Some Intermediate Nameservers may also have to be able to forward ECS
      queries they receive. This is described in <xref
      target="transitivity"/>.</t>

      <t>The mechanisms provided by ECS raise various security related
      concerns, related to cache growth, the ability to spoof EDNS0 options,
      and privacy. <xref target="security"/> explores various mitigation
      techniques.</t>

      <t>The expectation, however, is that this option will only be used by
      Recursive Resolvers and Authoritative Nameservers that incur geolocation
      issues.</t>

      <t>Most Recursive Resolvers, Authoritative Nameservers and Stub
      Resolvers will never know about this option, and will continue working
      as they had been.</t>

      <t>Failure to support this option or its improper handling will, at
      worst, cause suboptimal identification of client location, which is a
      common occurrence in current content delivery network (CDN) setups.</t>

      <t><xref target="originating"/> also provides a mechanism for Stub
      Resolvers to signal Recursive Resolvers that they do not want ECS
      treatment for specific queries.</t>

      <t>Additionally, operators of Intermediate Nameservers with ECS enabled
      are allowed to choose how many bits of the address of received queries
      to forward, or to reduce the number of bits forwarded for queries
      already including an ECS option.</t>

          <t>(Defined in <xref target="RFC6891"/>) OPTION-LENGTH, 2 octets,

          <t>FAMILY, 2 octets, indicates the family of the address contained
          in the option, using address family codes as assigned by IANA in

          target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/address-family-numbers/">
          IANA-AFI</eref>.</t>
        </list> The format of the address part depends on the value of FAMILY.
      This document only defines the format for FAMILY 1 (IP version 4) and 2
      (IP version 6), which are as follows: <list style="symbols">
          <t>SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH, unsigned octet specifying how many of the
          leftmost contiguous bits of the address comprise the query prefix.
          In replies, it mirrors the same value as in the queries. It can be
          set to 0 to disable client-based lookups, in which case the ADDRESS
          field MUST be absent.</t>

          <t>SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH, unsigned octet specifying how many of the
          leftmost contiguous bits of the address comprise the response
          prefix. In queries, it SHOULD be set to the longest cacheable length
          supported by the Intermediate Nameserver. For backwards
          compatibiilty with draft versions of this specification, in queries
          it MAY be set to 0 to have the Authoritative Nameserver treat the
          longest cacheable length as the SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH length. In
          responses, this field is set by the Authoritative Nameserver to
          indicate the coverage of the response. It might or might not be
          equal to SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH; it could be longer or shorter.</t>

          <t>ADDRESS, variable number of octets, contains either an IPv4 or
          IPv6 address, depending on FAMILY, truncated in the query to the
          number of bits indicated by the SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH field, with
          bits set to 0 to pad up to the end of the last octet used. (This
          need not be as many octets as a complete address would take.) In the
          reply, if the SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH of the query was 0 then ADDRESS
          must contain the same octets as in the query. Otherwise, the bits
          for ADDRESS will be significant through the maximum of the SOURCE
          PREFIX-LENGTH or SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH, and 0 filled to the end of an
          octet.</t>
        </list> All fields are in network byte order ("big-endian", per <xref
      target="RFC1700"/>, Data Notation).</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Protocol Description">
      <section anchor="originating" title="Originating the Option">
        <t>The ECS option should generally be added by Recursive Resolvers
        when querying Authoritative Nameservers, as described in <xref
        target="send_when"/>.  The option can also be initialized by a Stub
        Resolver or Forwarder.</t>

        <section anchor="originating_recursor" title="Recursive Resolvers">
          <t>The setup of the ECS option in a Recursive Resolver depends on the
          client query that triggered the resolution process.</t>

          <t>In the usual case, where no ECS option was present in the client
          query, the Recursive Resolver initializes the option by setting the
          FAMILY of the client's address. It then uses the value of its maximum
          cacheable prefix length to set both SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH and SCOPE
          PREFIX-LENGTH. For privacy reasons, and because the whole IP address
          is rarely required to determine a tailored response, this length
          SHOULD be shorter than the full address, as described in
          <xref target="security"/>.</t>

          <t>If the triggering query included an ECS option itself, it MUST be
          examined for its SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH. The Recursive Resolver's
          outgoing query MUST then set SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH to the shorter of
          the incoming query's SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH or the server's maximum
          cacheable prefix length. SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH is set to the server's
          maximum cacheable prefix length.</t>

          <t>Finally, in both cases, the ADDRESS is then added up to the SOURCE
          PREFIX-LENGTH number of bits, with trailing 0 bits added if needed to
          fill the final octet. The total number of octets used should only be
          enough to cover SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH bits, rather than the full width
          that would normally be used by addresses in FAMILY.</t>

          <t>FAMILY and ADDRESS information MAY be used from the ECS option
          incoming query. Passing the existing address data is supportive of
          the Recursive Resolver being used as the target of a Forwarder, but
          could possibly run into policy problems with regard to usage
          agreements between the Recursive Resolver and Authoritative
          Namserver. See <xref target="whitelist"/> for more discussion on this
          point. If the Recursive Resolver will not forward the FAMILY and
          ADDRESS data from the incoming ECS option, it MUST return a REFUSED
          response.</t>

          <t>Subsequent queries to refresh the data should always specify the
          longest SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH that the Recursive Resolver is willing to
          cache, even if a previous response indicated that a shorter prefix
          length was sufficient.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Stub Resolvers">
          <t>A Stub Resolver MAY generate DNS queries with an ECS option set to
          indicate its own level of privacy via SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH. An
          Intermediate Nameserver that receives such a query MUST NOT make
          queries that include more bits of client address than in the
          originating query.</t>

          <t>A SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH of 0 means the Recursive Resolver MUST NOT
          add address information of the client to its queries. The subsequent
          Recursive Resolver query to the Authoritative Nameserver will then
          either not include an ECS option or MAY optionally include its own
          address information, which is what the Authoritative Nameserver will
          almost certainly use to generate any Tailored Response in lieu of an
          option. This allows the answer to be handled by the same caching
          mechanism as other queries, with an explicit indicator of the
          applicable scope. Subsequent Stub Resolver queries for /0 can then be
          answered from this cached response.</t>

          <t>A Stub Resolver SHOULD set SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH to 0. It MAY
          include FAMILY and ADDRESS data, but should be prepared to handle a
          REFUSED response if the Intermediate Nameserver that it queries has a
          policy that denies forwarding of the ADDRESS. If there is no ADDRESS
          set, FAMILY MUST be set to 0.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Forwarders">
          <t>Forwarders essentially appear to be Stub Resolvers to whatever
          Recursive Resolver is ultimately handling the query, but look like a
          Recursive Resolver to their client. A Forwarder using this option
          MUST prepare it as described in the
          <xref target="originating_recursor"/> section above. In particular,
          a Forwarder that implements this protocol MUST honor SOURCE
          PREFIX-LENGTH restrictions indicated in the incoming query from its
          client. See also <xref target="transitivity"/>.</t>

          <t>Even though a Forwarder normally has a cache, it should be aware
          that any maximum cacheable length it sets in SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH will
          essentially be ignored, as the Recursive Resolver will use its own
          value for the purpose of managing its own cache.</t>

          <t>Since the Recursive Resolver it contacts will essentially treat it
          as a Stub Resolver, the Forwarder must be prepared for a REFUSED
          response if the Recursive Resolver does not permit incoming ADDRESS
          information. The Forwarded MUST retry with FAMILY and ADDRESS set to
          0.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section anchor="responding" title="Generating a Response">
        <section title="Authoritative Nameserver">
          <t>When a query containing an ECS option is received, an
          Authoritative Nameserver supporting ECS MAY use the address
          information specified in the option in order to generate a tailored
          response.</t>

          <t>Authoritative Nameservers that have not implemented or enabled
          support for the ECS option ought to safely ignore it within incoming
          queries, per <xref target="RFC6891"/> section 6.1.2.  Such a server
          MUST NOT include an ECS option within replies, to indicate lack of
          support for it.  Implementers of Intermediate Nameservers should be
          aware, however, that some nameservers incorrectly echo back unknown
          EDNS0 options.</t>

          <t>A query with a wrongly formatted option (e.g., an unknown FAMILY)
          MUST be rejected and a FORMERR response MUST be returned to the
          sender, as described by <xref target="RFC6891"/>, Transport
          Considerations.</t>

          <t>An Authoritative Nameserver that implements this protocol and
          receives an ECS option MUST include an ECS option in its response to
          indicate that it SHOULD be cached accordingly, regardless of whether
          the client information was needed to formulate an answer.  (Note that
          the <xref target="RFC6891"/> requirement to reserve space for the OPT
          record could mean that the answer section of the response will be
          truncated and fallback to TCP indicated accordingly.)  If an ECS
          option was not included in a query, one MUST NOT be included in the
          response even if the server is providing a tailored response
          (presumably based on the address from which it received the
          query).</t>

          <t>The FAMILY and SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH in the response MUST match
          those in the query. The first SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH bits of the
          ADDRESS in the response MUST match those in the query, even if fewer
          bits were used to form the response. Echoing back the address and
          prefix length helps to mitigate certain attack vectors, as described
          in <xref target="security"/>.</t>

          <t>The SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH in the response indicates the network for
          which the answer is intended. If a non-zero SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH was
          supplied in the query, the SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH of the response MAY
          be longer than the SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH of the query, to signal that
          more specific answers are available; however, the Authoritative
          Nameserver should still expect the response to be cached at the SCOPE
          PREFIX-LENGTH that the query indicated.</t>

          <t>A SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH value longer than the SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH
          indicates that the provided prefix length was not specific enough to
          select a single, best response. The ADDRESS MUST be extended to SCOPE
          PREFIX-LENGTH significant bits to indicate the network for which it
          is best suited.</t>

          <t>Conversely, a shorter SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH indicates that more bits
          than necessary were provided, and the answer is suitable for a
          broader range of addresses.  This could be as short as 0, to indicate
          that the answer is suitable for all addresses in FAMILY. [Open issue:
          you could make a decent case that it should be suitable for all
          addresses in all families; that's certainly simpler.]</t>

          <t>In both cases, the value of the SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH in the
          response indicates to Intermediate Nameservers how the response
          should be cached, as described in <xref target="caching"/>.</t>

          <t>As the logical topology of any part of the network with regard to
          the tailored response can vary, an Authoritative Nameserver may
          return different values of SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH for different
          networks.</t>

          <t>The specific logic that an Authoritative Nameserver uses to choose
          a tailored response is not in the scope of this document.
          Implementers are encouraged, however, to consider carefully their
          selection of SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH for the response in the event that
          the best tailored response cannot be determined. [Open issue: This
          seems so very vague; More text here about possible strategy?]</t>

          <t>If the authorative nameserver operator configures a more specific
          (longer prefix length) tailored response within a configured less
          specific (shorter prefix length) response, then implementations can
          either:</t>

          <t><list style="numbers">
              <t>Deaggregate the shorter prefix response into multiple longer
              prefix responses, or,</t>

              <t>Alert the operator that the order of queries will determine
              which answers get cached, and either warn and continue or treat
              this as an error and refuse to load the configuration.</t>
            </list>
          Which behavior is chosen is up to the implementation (and may be
          configured), but implementations MUST document this behavior.</t>

          <t>Under the original version and implementations of this protocol,
          Authoritative Nameservers have no idea what cache granularity the
          Recursive Resolver is willing to use. Legacy Recursive Resolvers will
          set SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH to 0 in their query, and possibly use a
          shorter SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH than their own maximum cacheable prefix
          length if the Recursive Resolver's client specified one. An
          Authoritative Nameserver implementation that receives one of these
          legacy queries should be aware that the originally specified caching
          semantics were that the Recursive Resolver was only supposed to use
          the response for other queries which used the same SOURCE
          PREFIX-LENGTH. This might impact how the Authoritative Nameserver
          determines a response.</t>

          <t>The issues of the previous paragraph are avoided under the current
          specification by allowing the Authoritative Nameserver to specify in
          its reply the network for which the response is intended.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Intermediate Nameserver">
          <t>When an Intermediate Nameserver uses ECS, whether it passes an ECS
          option in its own response to its client is predicated on whether the
          client originally included the option. Because a client that did not
          use an ECS option might not be able to understand it, the server MUST
          NOT provide one in its response. If the client query did include the
          option, the server MUST include one in its response, especially as it
          could be talking to a Forwarder which would need the information for
          its own caching.  [Open issue: if the Forwarder sent 0s for FAMILY
          and ADDRESS, how could it take back a response with non-zero FAMILY
          and ADDRESS when the spec says this mismatch MUST be dropped?]</t>

          <t>If an Intermediate Nameserver receives a response which has a
          longer SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH than the SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH that it
          provided in its query, it SHOULD still provide the result as the
          answer to the triggering client request even if the client is in a
          different address range.  The Intermediate Nameserver MAY instead opt
          to retry with a longer SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH to get a better reply
          before responding to its client, as long as it does not exceed a
          SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH specified in the query that triggered
          resolution, but this obviously has implications for the latency of
          the overall lookup.</t>

          <t>The logic for using the cache to determine whether the
          Intermediate Nameserver already knows the response to provide to its
          client is covered in the next section.</t>

      <section anchor="caching"
               title="Handling ECS Responses and Caching">
        <t>When an Intermediate Nameserver receives a response containing an
        ECS option and without the TC bit set, it SHOULD cache the result based
        on the data in the option. If the TC bit was set, the Intermediate
        Resolver SHOULD retry the query over TCP to get the complete answer
        section for caching.</t>

        <t>If the FAMILY, SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH, and SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH bits
        of ADDRESS in the response don't match the fields in the corresponding
        query, the full response MUST be dropped, as described in <xref
        target="security"/>.</t>

        <t>If no ECS option is contained in the response, the Intermediate
        Nameserver MUST treat this as being equivalent to having received a
        SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH of 0, which is an answer suitable for all client
        addresses.</t>

        <section title="Caching the Response">
          <t>In the cache, any resource record in the answer section will be
          tied to the network specified by the FAMILY, ADDRESS and SCOPE
          PREFIX-LENGTH fields, as limited by the Intermediate Nameserver's own
          configuration for maximum cacheable prefix length. Note that the
          additional and authority sections from a DNS response message are
          specifically excluded here. Any records from these sections MUST NOT
          be tied to a network. [Open issue: this conflicts a bit with
          draft-kumari-dnsop-multiple-responses, which wants to put data in
          the additional section that an authoritative nameserver that does
          ECS would probably want to tailor.]</t>

          <t>[Open issue: whether negative responses should be tied to the
          network. The authors are not in agreement on this issue.]</t>

          <t>Records that are cached as /0 because of a query's SOURCE
          PREFIX-LENGTH of 0 MUST be distinguished from those that are cached
          as /0 because of a response's SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH of 0. The former
          should only be used for other /0 queries that the Intermediate
          Resolver receives, but the latter is suitable as a response for all
          networks.</t>

          <t>Although omitting network-specific caching will significantly
          simplify an implementation, the resulting drop in cache hits is very
          likely to defeat most latency benefits provided by ECS. Therefore,
          when implementing this option for latency purposes, implementing full
          caching support as described in this section is strongly
          recommended.</t>

          <t>Enabling support for ECS in an Intermediate Nameserver will
          significantly increase the size of the cache, reduce the number of
          results that can be served from cache, and increase the load on the
          server. Implementing the mitigation techniques described in
          <xref target="security"/> is strongly recommended.</t>

        <section title="Answering from Cache">
          <t>Cache lookups are first done as usual for a DNS query, using the

      <section anchor="transitivity" title="Transitivity">
        <t>Generally, ECS options will only be present in DNS messages between
        a Recursive Resolver and an Authoritative Nameserver, i.e., one hop.
        In certain configurations however, for example multi-tier nameserver
        setups, it may be necessary to implement transitive behaviour on
        Intermediate Nameservers.</t>

        <t>It is important that any Intermediate Nameserver that forwards ECS
        options received from their clients MUST fully implement the caching
        behaviour described in <xref target="caching"/>.</t>

        <t>Compliant Intermediate Nameservers that receive an incoming query
        containing ECS with SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH set to 0 (that is, completely
        anonymized), MUST forward the query with SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH set to 0
        and MUST NOT replace it with an option with more accurate address
        information.</t>

        <t>An Intermediate Nameserver MAY also forward ECS options with actual
        address information. This information MAY match the source IP address
        of the incoming query, and MAY have more or less address bits than the
        Nameserver would normally include in a locally originated ECS
        option.</t>

        <t>If for any reason the Intermediate Nameserver does not want to use
        the information in an ECS option it receives (too little address
        information, network address from a range not authorized to use the
        server, private/unroutable address space, etc), it SHOULD drop the
        query and return a REFUSED response. Note again that an ECS option

    <section title="NAT Considerations">
      <t>Special awareness of ECS in devices that perform Network Address
      Translation (NAT) as described in <xref target="RFC2663"/> is not
      required; queries can be passed through as-is. The client's network
      address SHOULD NOT be added, and existing ECS options, if present,
      SHOULD NOT be modified by NAT devices.</t>

      <t>In large-scale global networks behind NAT (but, for example, with a
      Centralized Resolver infrastructure), an internal Intermediate
      Nameserver might have detailed network layout information, and might
      know which external subnets are used for egress traffic by each internal
      network. In such cases, the Intermediate Nameserver MAY use that
      information when originating ECS options.</t>

      <t>In other cases, Recursive Resolvers sited behind a NAT device SHOULD
      NOT originate ECS options with their IP address, and instead rely on
      downstream Intermediate Nameservers doing so. They MAY, however, choose
      to include the option with their internal address for the purposes of
      signaling a shorter, more anonymous SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH.</t>

      <t>If an Authoritative Nameserver on the publicly routed Internet
      receives a query that specifies an ADDRESS in <xref target="RFC1918"/>
      or <xref target="RFC4193"/> private address space, it SHOULD ignore
      ADDRESS and look up its answer based on the address of the Recursive
      Resolver. In the response it SHOULD set SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH to cover all
      of the relevant private space. For example, a query for ADDRESS 10.1.2.0
      with a SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH of 24 would get a returned SCOPE
      PREFIX-LENGTH of 8. The Intermediate Nameserver MAY elect to cache the
      answer under one entry for <xref target="RFC6890">special-purpose
      addresses</xref>; see <xref target="pollution"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <section title="Privacy">
        <t>With the ECS option, the network address of the client that
        initiated the resolution becomes visible to all servers involved in
        the resolution process. Additionally, it will be visible from any
        network traversed by the DNS packets.</t>

        <t>To protect users' privacy, Recursive Resolvers are strongly
        encouraged to conceal part of the IP address of the user by truncating
        IPv4 addresses to 24 bits. 48 bits are recommended for IPv6, based on
        the length of the aggregatable global routing prefix.</t>

        <t>When a non-zero SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH is provided by the Recursive
        Resolver that is longer than SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH, users can often
        obtain more optimal mapping if the resolver is well-used. Replies will
        have answers tailored up to SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH bits for a subset of
        the SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH. Subsequent queries within the TTL from
        clients within the cached range will be served the optimal answer,
        while still preserving privacy of the user.</t>

        <t>ISPs should have more detailed knowledge of their own networks. That
        is, they might know that all 24-bit prefixes in a /20 are in the same
        area. In those cases, for optimal cache utilization and improved
        privacy, the ISP's Recursive Resolver SHOULD truncate IP addresses in
        this /20 to just 20 bits, instead of 24 as recommended above.</t>

        <t>Users who wish their full IP address to be hidden can include an
        ECS option specifying the wildcard address (i.e. SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH
        of 0). As described in previous sections, this option will be
        forwarded across all the Recursive Resolvers supporting ECS, which
        MUST NOT modify it to include the network address of the client.</t>

        <t>Note that even without an ECS option, any server queried directly
        by the user will be able to see the full client IP address. Recursive
        Resolvers or Authoritative Nameservers MAY use the source IP address
        of queries to return a cached entry or to generate a tailored
        response that best matches the query.</t>

      <section title="Birthday Attacks">
        <t>ECS adds information to the DNS query tuple (q-tuple). This allows
        an attacker to send a caching Intermediate Nameserver multiple queries
        with spoofed IP addresses either in the ECS option or as the source
        IP. These queries will trigger multiple outgoing queries with the same
        name, type and class, just different address information in the ECS
        option.</t>

        <t>With multiple queries for the same name in flight, the attacker has
        a higher chance of success in sending a matching response with
        the SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH being 0 (meaning an empty prefix) to get it
        cached for many hosts.</t>

        <t>To counter this, every ECS option in a response packet MUST contain
        the FAMILY and SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH fields from the corresponding
        query, along with identical ADDRESS bits for SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH
        length. Intermediate Nameservers processing a response MUST verify

        <t>Additionally, Recursive Resolvers MAY be configured to never send
        the option when querying root, top-level, and effective top-level
        domain servers. These domains are delegation-centric and are very
        unlikely to generate different replies based on the address of the
        client.</t>

        <t>When probing, it is important that several things are probed:
        support for ECS, support for EDNS0, support for EDNS0 options, or
        possibly an unreachable Nameserver. Various implementations are known
        to drop DNS packets with OPT RRs (with or without options), thus
        several probes are required to discover what is supported.</t>

        <t>Probing, if implemented, MUST be repeated periodically (i.e.
        daily). If an Authoritative Nameserver indicates ECS support for one
        zone, it is to be expected that the Nameserver supports ECS for all
        its zones. Likewise, an Authoritative Nameserver that uses ECS
        information for one of its zones, MUST indicate support for the option
        in all its responses. If the option is supported but not actually used
        for generating a response, its SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH value SHOULD be set
        to 0.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="whitelist" title="Whitelist">
        <t>As described previously, it is expected that only a few Recursive
        Resolvers will need to use ECS, and that it will generally be enabled
        only if it offers a clear benefit to the users.</t>

        <t>To avoid the complexity of implementing a probing and detection
        mechanism (and the possible query loss/delay that may come with it), an
        implementation could use a whitelist of Authoritative
        Namesevers to send the option to, likely specified by their domain
        name. Implementations MAY also allow additionally configuring this
        based on other criteria, such as zone or query type.</t>

        <t>An additional advantage of using a whitelist is that partial client
        address information is only disclosed to Nameservers that are known to
        use the information, improving privacy.</t>

        <t>A major drawback is scalability. The operator needs to track which
        Authoritative Nameservers support ECS, making it harder for new
        Authoritative Nameservers to start using the option.</t>

        <t>Similarly, Authoritative Nameservers can also use whitelists to
        limit the feature to only certain clients.  For example, a CDN that
        does not want all of their mapping trivially walked might require a
        legal agreement with the Recursive Resolver operator, to clearly
        describe the acceptable use of the feature.</t>

        <t>The maintenance of access control mechanisms is out of scope for
        this protocol definition.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Example">
      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>A stub resolver SR with IP address 192.0.2.37 tries to resolve
          www.example.com, by forwarding the query to the Recursive Resolver
          RNS from IP address IP, asking for recursion.</t>

          <t>RNS, supporting ECS, looks up www.example.com in its cache. An
          entry is found neither for www.example.com, nor for example.com.</t>

          <t>RNS builds a query to send to the root and .com servers. The
          implementation of RNS provides facilities so an administrator can
          configure it not to forward ECS in certain cases. In particular,
          RNS is configured to not include an ECS option when talking to
          delegation-centric nameservers, as described in <xref
          target="originating"/>. Thus, no ECS option is added, and resolution
          is performed as usual.</t>

          <t>RNS now knows the next server to query, Authoritative Nameserver
          ANS, responsible for example.com.</t>

          <t>RNS prepares a new query for www.example.com, including an ECS
          option with: <list style="symbols">
              <t>OPTION-CODE, set to 0x00 0x08.</t>

              <t>OPTION-LENGTH, set to 0x00 0x07 for the following fixed 4
              octets plus the 3 octets that will be used for ADDRESS.</t>

              <t>FAMILY, set to 0x00 0x01 as IP is an IPv4 address.</t>

              <t>SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH, set to 0x18, as RNS is configured to
              conceal the last 8 bits of every IPv4 address.</t>

              <t>SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH, set to 0x1B, as RNS is willing to cache
              answers up to a /27.</t>

              <t>ADDRESS, set to 0xC0 0x00 0x02, providing only the first 24
              bits of the IPv4 address.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The query is sent. Server ANS understands and uses ECS. It parses
          the ECS option, and generates a tailored response.</t>

          <t>Due to the internal implementation of ANS, it finds an answer
          that is optimal for several /27 ranges within the ADDRESS/SOURCE
          PREFIX-LENGTH of the query. It chooses one randomly. (Note well,
          this is just one example of how ANS could pick a suitable answer.
          Other selection methods are possible.)</t>

          <t>The Authoritative Nameserver ANS adds an ECS option in the
          response, containing: <list style="symbols">
              <t>OPTION-CODE, set to 0x00 0x08.</t>

              <t>OPTION-LENGTH, set to 0x00 0x08 for the following fixed 4
              octets plus the 4 octets that will be used for ADDRESS .</t>

              <t>FAMILY, set to 0x00 0x01, the same as the query.</t>

              <t>SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH, set to 0x18, copied from the query.</t>

              <t>SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH, set to 0x1B, indicating a /27
              network.</t>

              <t>ADDRESS, set to 0xC0 0x00 0x02 0xE0, copied and extended from
              the query.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>RNS receives the response containing an ECS option. The resolver
          verifies that FAMILY, SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH, and the SOURCE
          PREFIX-LENGTH bits of ADDRESS match the query. If not, the message
          is discarded.</t>

          <t>The response is interpreted as usual. Since the response contains
          an ECS option, the ADDRESS, SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH, and FAMILY in the
          response are used to cache the entry.</t>

          <t>RNS sends a response to stub resolver SR, without including an
          ECS option.</t>

          <t>RNS receives another query to resolve www.example.com. This
          time, a response is cached. The response, however, is tied to a
          particular network. If the address of the client matches any network
          in the cache, then the response is returned from the cache.
          Otherwise, another query is performed. If multiple results match,
          the one with the longest SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH is chosen, as per
          common best-network match algorithms.</t>
